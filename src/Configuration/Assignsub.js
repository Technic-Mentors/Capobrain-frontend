      <p>The subjects you enter in this module's subject module will now be assigned to classes, and you can allocate several subjects to the same class. After selecting the branch, class, and section, you will check the subject that you will teach in the chosen class. You can also view, edit, and delete those subjects, but you cannot directly delete a subject that has been assigned to a class without first receiving an alert. Only subjects that aren't assigned to anyone can be deleted.</p>

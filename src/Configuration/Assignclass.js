      <p>The module for assigning courses to teachers includes information on which class each teacher has been given. You must first choose the branch name, instructor, and class or section that you want to assign to that teacher. The first instructor you assign will be in control of the class if you assign numerous teachers to the same class. So you can easily figure out which class has assign to which teacher. You can also change or remove this data. </p>

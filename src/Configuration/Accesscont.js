      <p>Access control is a key component of data security that governs who has access to and uses which modules and resources. Access control limits access to specified modules to specific people based on their jobs. In this section, you will pick the role and then check the modules that you want to give to the selected role so that the specific individual cannot access any other modules besides their allocated one.</p>

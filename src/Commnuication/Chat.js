      <p>Undoubtedly, this module will be utilized for communication, but it will be between school users and their parents. The proper chat room is this one. There is a chat feature on the parent portal that allows parents to send messages to the school. The school will receive the relevant message with the parent's name and answer appropriately.</p>

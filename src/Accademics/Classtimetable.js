      <p>We all know that every school has a class schedule that shows which instructor will be lecturing in which class, and this module operates in the same way. This is where you will choose the teacher, class, subject, and time for each subject. You will select the class time with instructor details so that teachers may quickly figure out the lecture time of any class.</p>

      <p>This is where a school user can add a help material for any subject. They can send it to everyone if you want them to. If you wish to send it to a certain class, subject, or teacher, they can do so as well. You will choose a title, a file to upload, a date, and who you want to send it to. As a result, everyone has access to this content through their own portal.</p>

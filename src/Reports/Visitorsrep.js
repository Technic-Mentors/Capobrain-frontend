    <p>A visitor report provides a comprehensive record of individuals who have entered a school premises for various purposes. This report typically includes details such as the visitor's name, the time they arrived (in time) and the time they departed (out time), as well as information about the person they came to meet. Depending on the nature of the visit, the report will reveal specific details about the visitor; for instance, if the visitor is a student, it will provide student-specific information, while if it's a staff member, it will contain staff-related details. Visitor reports are crucial for maintaining security, tracking attendance, and ensuring the safety of everyone within the school environment.</p>

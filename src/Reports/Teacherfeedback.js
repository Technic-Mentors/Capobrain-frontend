        A staff feedback report is a document that summarizes and presents
        feedback, comments, or evaluations provided by employees about their
        workplace, job, colleagues, and other aspects of their employment. These
        reports are typically created by management to assess employee
        satisfaction, identify areas for improvement, and make informed
        decisions to enhance the working environment. This report will show you
        the staff detail and the rating stars of that staff. You can search any
        staff by select their branch, class, section and name.

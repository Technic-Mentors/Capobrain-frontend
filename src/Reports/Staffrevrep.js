    <p>A staff review report is a document that provides an overview of teacher performance within a specific branch or educational institution. It typically includes information such as the branch name, teacher details (including their name, class, section, and identification number), a rating in the form of stars, and a status indicating their performance or evaluation. This report serves as a valuable tool for assessing and monitoring the effectiveness of educators, facilitating data-driven decision-making and continuous improvement in the educational system.</p>

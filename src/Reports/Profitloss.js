    <p>A profit and loss report, also known as an income statement, is a financial report that provides a summary of a organizationâ€™s revenues, costs, and expenses over a specific period, typically a month, quarter, or year. It shows the net profit or loss by subtracting the total expenses from the total revenue, serving as a vital tool for assessing a business's financial performance and overall profitability. This report helps businesses track their financial health, make informed decisions, and communicate their financial status to stakeholders.</p>

      <p>We absolutely need the course category before we can add the course, thus add the course category first, then the course. After you enter the title, outcomes, and description of the course, you will select the branch, class, and teacher who will teach the course, as well as whether the course will be paid or free. After you save it, it will display a list of all courses for you to view, edit, and delete.</p>

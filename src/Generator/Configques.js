    <p>The third module in the paper generator's hierarchy is configure question. You can configure questions in this, but you must select the chapter and topic of the questions you intend to add first.  You will choose a branch, class, section, subject, chapter name, chapter topic, and then a question pertaining to that topic. You may include a number of queries. Any moment, you can quickly see, amend, or remove any question.</p>
